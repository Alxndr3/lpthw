Make a Game Engine
Gothons from Planet Percal #25

Write or Draw About the Problem
"Aliens have invades a space ship and our hero has to go through a maze of 
rooms defeating them so he can escape into an escape pod to the planet below.
The game will be more like a Zork or Adventure type game with text outputs and
funny ways to die. The game will involve an engine that runs a map full of
rooms or scenes. Each room will print its own description when the player
enters it and then tell the engine what room to run next out of the map".
